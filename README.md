# Telecom Churn Prediction Project

In the fiercely competitive telecom industry, customer retention is crucial. With an average annual churn rate of 15-25%, predicting and preventing customer churn has become a top priority. This project focuses on analyzing customer-level data from a leading telecom firm, leveraging machine learning models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

## Key Steps:

### Data Understanding and Preparation:

- Identify useful attributes and estimate variable importance.
- Perform data cleaning, missing values imputation, and outlier removal.
- Standardize columns (e.g., date) into a consistent format.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Conduct preliminary analysis, including correlation identification and scatter plots.
- Perform advanced analysis with heatmaps, histograms, and basic clustering to discover data patterns.

### Feature Engineering and Variable Transformation:

- Create new potentially useful variables through feature engineering.
- Apply categorical and numerical variable transformations for data scaling.

### Model Selection, Building, and Prediction:

- Identify the problem type and select models.
- Choose a training mechanism (e.g., cross-validation) and tune hyperparameters.
- Test each model and evaluate based on predefined metrics.
- Utilize ensemble methods to enhance model efficacy.

## Models Explored:

- Logistic Regression
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Random Forest

This repository houses the code and documentation for the end-to-end process, offering insights into the telecom churn prediction journey.

*Note: This project was undertaken as part of a competition, aiming to build a predictive model for identifying churning customers based on provided usage features.*
